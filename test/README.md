# Test if the sources compile

Cross compile the STM32F7 HAL sources,
with all warnings enabled, with the standard `arm-none-eabi-` GCC compiler.

To run the test, go to the packet folder and start the script:

```
PATH=/usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3/bin:$PATH
cd stm32f7-hal-xpack
bash ../../../scripts/run-tests.sh
```

The script will create `build/tests`, copy the source files and compile them.
